### Hello!

#### About me
- As of October 2020, I have started on a new adventure as a Cloud Engineer at [metro-markets.de](https://www.metro-markets.de/)
- My main professional interests are System Administration and Software Engineering. Both topics are very large, and I still have much to learn!
- Golang is my favourite programming language, and I've been a Xubuntu user for about 10 years
- I hold [CKA](https://github.com/DanielCalvo/DanielCalvo/blob/master/cka.png), [AWS Associate Architect](https://github.com/DanielCalvo/DanielCalvo/blob/master/aws_arch_associate.jpeg) and LPIC 1 & 2 certifications. Certifications are fun to study for, I'll get some more as time goes on
- I have a few ideas of topics to write about and things to engineer, but so far they're only ideas. More to come soon!

#### Contact
